Explorers
=========

An Explorer is a Jupyter notebook containing IPython widgets to allow the user to select a set of options in order to plot an Iris cube.

For our first release of Cube Browser we have constructed one such work flow, which you can access via the links below to either run directly from this web browser or download and run from your desktop.
This Explorer allows the user to choose and load one cube from the desired data path (default is GloSea4 ensemble data in the Iris sample data directory),
choose the plot type and the coordinates to plot on the X and Y axis, and then plot the cube.

Links to Cube Explorers

Usage
-----

To run the notebook from your web browser, simply click the link above and this will open the notebook.
When your kernel is ready, run the first cell to open your set of widgets.  These will provide you with options with which to plot your cube.

To download the notebook, you will need an environment which possesses the requirements to run it.
The installation instructions on the `homepage<index.html>`_ will provide this capability.
Make sure you have a terminal with the Cube Browser environment activated, change directory to the location of your downloaded notebook, and then type:

`jupyter notebook`

This will open a notebook tree from which you can access your Explorer.
Once you have opened it, you can follow the steps above for running the notebook from your browser.
