Cube Explorers
==============

A Cube Explorer is a Jupyter notebook containing widgets that allow the user to select a set of options for plotting Iris cube data.

For our first release of Cube Browser we have constructed a template notebook.  You can download the notebook via the link below and run it from your own desktop.
Our example utilizes data from the GloSea4 ensemble data in the Iris sample data directory, but you can change this to the location of your own data files.
You will be able to choose and load one or more Iris cube(s), then choose the plot type and the coordinates for the X and Y axis to make up to two plots.
