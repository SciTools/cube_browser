Cube Explorers
==============

A Cube Explorer is a Jupyter notebook containing widgets that allow the user to select a set of options for plotting Iris cube data.

For our first release of Cube Browser we have constructed a template notebook.  You can download the notebook via the link below and run it from your own desktop.
Our example utilizes data from the GloSea4 ensemble data in the Iris sample data directory, but you can change this to the location of your own data files.
You will be able to choose and load one or more Iris cube(s), then choose the plot type and the coordinates for the X and Y axis to make up to two plots.

You can see a demonstration version of explorer via the mybinder service.
This is freely hosted by generous people, but it is not fast and you should not load your own data into the sessions; it uses Iris sample data instead: `mybinder Cube Explorer <http://mybinder.org/repo/scitools/cube_browser/tree/doc/explorers/explore.ipynb>`_.
	  
Usage
-----

`Open the notebook <../index.html>`_ and run the first cell to open your set of widgets.  These will provide you with options with which to plot your cube.
When you have selected and loaded your cube and then made your plotting selections, press the 'Plot my Cube' button to produce your plot(s).
