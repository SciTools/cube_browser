Writing Your Own Cube Browser
=============================

You can use the Cube Browser and IPython widgets packages to write your own Explorer notebooks which can offer as little or as many options and widgets as you wish.

This approach is not as simple as just making plots using the Cube Browser API, but it gives you the opportunity to create a template or structure for plots which you make repeatedly.

The following pages provide guidance about how to start constructing a cube explorer, along with several examples of the widgets you can use.
