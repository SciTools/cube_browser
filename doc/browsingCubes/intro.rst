Browsing Cubes
==============

The Cube Browser package offers an API which you can use to visualize your cubes in a Jupyter notebook.
It utilizes the Python, Matplotlib, Iris and Cartopy libraries while offering the additional functionality of plotting an entire cube without having to slice it.

You can make use of the Cube Browser library to write a short notebook to display your Iris cube data.
There are several advantages of using this approach, but the main advantage is flexibility in the options you can apply to each plot.
Additionally, if you know what plots you would like and how you would like them laid out, this is a very quick way of producing your plots and exploring your cube data.
