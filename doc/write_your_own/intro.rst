Writing Your Own Cube Explorer
==============================

You can use the Cube Browser package and the IPython widgets package to write your own Explorer notebooks which can offer as many options and widgets as you wish.

This approach is not as simple as making plots using the Cube Browser interface alone, but it gives you the opportunity to create your own structure for repeated plotting, almost like a personalised Graphical User Interface.

The following pages provide guidance about how to start constructing your own `Cube Explorer <../explorers/intro.html>`_, along with several examples of the widgets you can use.
