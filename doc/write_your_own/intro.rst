Writing Your Own Cube Browser
=============================

You can use the Cube Browser and IPython widgets packages to write your own Explorer notebooks which can offer as few or as many options and widgets as you wish.

This approach is not as simple as making plots using the Cube Browser API alone, but it gives you the opportunity to create your own GUI-like structure for repeated plotting.

The following pages provide guidance about how to start constructing a cube explorer, along with several examples of the widgets you can use.
